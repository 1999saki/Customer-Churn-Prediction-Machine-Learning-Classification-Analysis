This project aims to familiarize users with Python programming, classification techniques, and data handling. It focuses on data preprocessing and implementing classification algorithms, including Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The project also explores the challenges associated with labeled data and provides detailed interpretations of the classification results.

Project Overview
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature selection.
Classification Algorithms: Implement and evaluate Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM classifiers.
Analysis: Interpret the results, compare model performances, and discuss the challenges of working with labeled data.
